This project is done freely, and made available for the community to use.
But creating and maintaining software takes time. Donating to this project not only
supports its development, it also helps me afford more time to create tools like this
for the community. ‚ù§

**Note**
> Nitefox does not download from spotify directly due to restrictions and copyright. What it does is find out if it is available
